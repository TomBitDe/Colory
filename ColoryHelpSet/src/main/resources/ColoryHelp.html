<H1>Colory Online Help</H1>
Colory is a kind of a memory game.
<p>
Push the 'Start' button to begin. Colory plays a sequence of colored areas to be pushed.
Repeat the sequence by pushing the colored areas. You win if you can exactly repeat the
Colory sequence. Otherwise you loose.
<p>
On win Colory increases the maximum number of colored areas to be pushed next time.
Otherwise the maximum number of buttons to be pushed next time is reduced by one.
Minimum is three colored areas to be pushed.
<p>
Every colored area is combined with a sound. So turn on or increase the volume of your
sound device.
<p>
Have a look on the text line below the colored areas. The text displayed here guides you through the game.
