Colory Help

Colory is a kind of a memory game.

Push the 'Start' button to begin. Colory plays a sequence of colored areas to be pushed.
Repeat the sequence by pushing the colored areas in Colory. You win if you can exactly
repeat the Colory sequence. Otherwise you loose.

On win Colory increases the maximum number of colored areas to be pushed in the next sequence.
Otherwise the maximum number of buttons to be pushed in the next sequence is reduced by one.

Every colored area is combined with a sound. So turn on or increase the volume of your
sound device.

You can replay the sequence give by Colory using the replay button.

You can switch off/on sound effects by using Colory speaker toggle button.

You can change Colory look and feel by using the combobox.
